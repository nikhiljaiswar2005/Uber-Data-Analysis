In this project, I performed an analysis on Uber cabs 2016 data.
During the analysis, I carried out several data transformation steps:
Cleaned the data
Removed duplicates
Filled in missing values
Transformed columns for better usability

For the analysis, I used various Python libraries, including:
Pandas – for handling DataFrames
Matplotlib – for data visualization
Seaborn – for creating box plots

By using these methods and libraries, I was able to derive several insights, which you can find in my Python source code.
